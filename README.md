# FoodRecomendationWeb
This is a Java website developed by Eclipse. This project was developed by me and my classmate and I have put the table about the task of each member in the slide powerpoint.

The main function of this website is about suggesting user to choose which food they need based on the material. Whenever the user enter the input about the material, the website will suggest which food are made by that material (it can up to 2 material or more).

Or if user just wants to search food, the website supply the food which is sorted by: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and so on.

Beside, I have developed the admin which function is to manage the food (CRUD), the user (about account and information), the food title. And of course this website can be developed more with some AI algorithm to supply the food that user wants to find correctlyer.

All of the website about the display, how the function work and the database have been put in the slide and the project. Glad to introduce you about my project. Have a nice day.
